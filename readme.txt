Best DNS Finder v 1.0

A tool to find the best performing dns server which doesn't measure the performance of the dns server itself (which represents miniscule amounts of improvements in your traffic generally) but the actual performance to the end sites itself.

Made by Shantanu Goel http://tech.shantanugoel.com/

Add DNS server addresses in dns-servers.txt
Add sites to which you want to measure your performance to sites.txt
Run "python best-dns-finder.py"

Tons of TODOs left before this can be considered world-ready :)
